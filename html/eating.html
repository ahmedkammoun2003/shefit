            Eating disorders (EDs) affect at least 9% of the global population and are responsible for more deaths than any other mental health issue, second only to opioid overdoses. Research on eating disorders has historically focused on white women from highly educated and industrialized countries, but we are learning that other cultural groups may have even higher levels of risk. Anyone living in a culture that promotes thinness as an ideal of attractiveness is susceptible to experiencing eating disorders. In the United States, for example, gay men, transgender individuals, autistic individuals, and Hispanic women all have a higher-than-average risk of developing eating disorders. <br>
            Despite the grim statistics, help is available. Getting better or helping someone you love on the path to recovery starts with awareness. Let's begin by exploring the characteristics, possible causes, and impact of eating disorders. In the second part of this series, we will address therapeutic approaches.

        <h1>Anorexia</h1>
        <p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a resource commonly used by mental health professionals for diagnosis, anorexia is characterized by severe calorie restriction, fear of gaining weight, and distorted body image. Individuals with anorexia may also engage in behaviors such as excessive exercise, binge eating, and purging. Ritualistic eating behaviors such as cutting food into small bites, arranging food in patterns, or chewing food a certain number of times before swallowing are also common. Anorexia can be very harsh on the body, leading to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, dizziness, fainting, the development of a fine layer of hair all over the body, feeling cold, and difficulty concentrating. Long-term physical risks include weakened immune function, muscle weakness, and heart failure.</p>
        <h2>Contributing Factors</h2>
        <p>
            Factors contributing to eating disorders in general and anorexia specifically occur at individual, familial, and systemic levels. Certain personality traits such as avoidance, perfectionism, and self-focus appear to predict a higher risk of anorexia. Family environments where children are encouraged to be thin, strong, or athletic to maintain parental affection or positive regard also increase the risk of anorexia. Cultural groups where thinness is portrayed as the beauty ideal have among the highest rates of anorexia compared to cultures where thinness is not seen as a condition of attractiveness. <br>
            Genetics and brain chemistry play a central biological role in the development of anorexia. Having a first-degree parent with anorexia increases the risk by 11%. Dopamine and serotonin, chemical messengers that help regulate mood, sleep, appetite, and reward-seeking behaviors, are also involved in the development of anorexia. Individuals with anorexia have up to 30% less dopamine byproduct than those without anorexia, a reduction that often persists even after recovery, contributing to mood and anxiety symptoms.

        <h2>Lived Experience</h2>
        <p>"Caleb" came out as gay to his family when he was 14 years old. His father downplayed Caleb's news, choosing instead to focus on his hopes that Caleb would work to become part of the college basketball team. When his father suddenly passed away the following year, Caleb lost a lot of weight; his appetite disappeared into a well of grief. The only relief he felt was from his long afternoon runs, gradually increasing from one hour to two. His friend group started complimenting him on his sleeker appearance, and a boy he was interested in asked him out. Caleb began regularly skipping breakfast to ensure he wouldn't gain weight. He felt a strange satisfaction each time he overcame a hunger pang without eating.

        <div class="graycolor">
            <h1>Bulimia</h1>
            <p>
                Bulimia is often overlooked by healthcare providers, as many individuals meeting criteria are average-sized or larger. Individuals with bulimia often suffer longer without treatment than those with more visible eating disorders. Symptoms include binge eating, meaning consuming large amounts of food in a short time uncontrollably, despite feeling full or physical discomfort. Bingeing is accompanied by behaviors aimed at mitigating the impact of the binge, such as induced vomiting, use of laxatives or diuretics, and/or overexercise. Similar to anorexia, individuals with bulimia center their self-esteem primarily on the size and shape of their bodies. Long-term physical consequences may include esophageal damage, tooth decay, and an increased risk of esophageal cancer.<br>
                Contributing Factors<br>
                Similar to anorexia and other eating disorders, a complex interplay of social, individual, and biological factors contribute to the development of bulimia. Individuals with bulimia are more likely to score higher on measures of sensation-seeking behaviors (similar to individuals with addiction disorders), negative emotionality, and a trait called neuroticism, which includes tendencies toward worry, anxiety, fear, and assuming the worst. Eye-tracking studies have shown that individuals with bulimia spend more time looking at "problem areas" of their bodies than individuals with anorexia or no eating disorder. This hyperfocus may increase distress that individuals with bulimia alleviate through bingeing and reinforce the need for behaviors such as vomiting to improve the "problem area" body zone.

            <h2>Lived Experience</h2>
            <p>"Gloria" was the first person in her family to attend college. Her parents had immigrated from Mexico to the United States when she was two and held down several jobs to afford her a private school education. An only child with an outgoing personality, she made it her mission to make her parents proud by being an excellent student. She often felt excluded from social groups in the predominantly white high school she attended. The pressure to succeed and the desire to fit in reached a boiling point as she prepared her college applications for her senior year. With each application completed, she would reward herself with a dozen donuts, intending to eat them slowly over several days. As she tore into the sixth donut, she felt a mix of relief and guilt: it was okay to indulge, but it was shameful to be so out of control. She began vomiting to alleviate her overfullness and sense of shame.

        <h1>Binge Eating Disorder</h1>
        <p>
            Binge Eating Disorder (BED) involves the same overeating behavior observed in bulimia without the drastic purging behaviors such as overexercise or vomiting. Most individuals with BED engage in frequent diets to mitigate the impact of binge eating on weight. The risk of high blood pressure and type II diabetes is doubled in individuals with BED, and risks are increased with fibromyalgia. Binge eating episodes are marked by a sense of loss of control, feelings of shame, and are often preceded by intense planning, secrecy, and hoarding of food. <br><br>
            Contributing Factors<br>
            Binge Eating Disorder was only recognized by the medical community as a discrete disorder in 2013, so research is limited regarding causal and contributing factors. There is consistent overlap between the neurocognitive characteristics of eating disorders and addiction disorders in general, but the links may be even stronger for BED. Similar to individuals with addiction disorders, individuals with BED are more reward-sensitive, impulsive, and less punishment-sensitive, likely contributing to bingeing. It's important to note that these are involuntary cognitive processes not actively chosen by individuals with characteristics such as high impulsivity. We may tend to assume that someone could decide to be less impulsive, for example, but brain imaging and psychological studies indicate it's not that simple. <br>    
            Lived Experience<br>
            "Cory" was constantly on the move in her life: a mother of three, a high school science teacher, and a support for her freelance husband. At the start of each week, she would try to motivate herself with goals to eat healthier and go to the gym, but by Wednesday, her best-laid plans were thwarted as her to-do list grew longer. For the past two years, every Thursday night found her sitting on her bed, eating entire packs of cookies, bags of chips, and drinking beer. As the alcohol kicked in, she remembered she had always wanted to write a book about her sexual assault, something to help other survivors feel seen. Overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and failure, she would sneak out to throw her food wrappers in the community trash so her family wouldn't know how much she had eaten.
