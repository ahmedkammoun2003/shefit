            <h1>Socio-Emotional Well-being</h1>
            <p>
                Family meals enhance the socio-emotional well-being of children, meaning they tend to have more stable emotional states and higher levels of vitality in their lives. Children from families that have more than 7 family meals per week (whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner) exhibit fewer depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. <br>Specifically, girls are twice as likely to report a suicide attempt when their families have more than seven meals together per week (Eisenberg et al., 2004). Lastly, a higher frequency of family meals is also associated with greater self-esteem in children (Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2010).
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Substance Use</h1>
        <p>Family meals might even be powerful enough in children's lives to prevent future substance use. One study found that the frequency of family meals was associated with lower rates of substance use in girls, but not in boys (Eisenberg et al., 2008). <br>Specifically, a higher frequency of family meals is linked to lower rates of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use five years later (Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2010). <br>These benefits are independent of family functioning, suggesting that the protective nature of family meals against substance use in children occurs even when families have poor relationships (Eisenberg et al., 2008).</p>
        <div class="graycolor">
            <h1>Eating Disorders</h1>
            <p>Significant attention has been given to the role family meals play in preventing eating disorders. The frequency of family meals is linked to a decrease in disordered eating behaviors (such as purging, restriction, and binge eating), unhealthy weight control behaviors, and dieting for both men and women (Loth et al., 2015), but the overall atmosphere of the family meal plays a crucial role. It's important for the family to feel connected and for parents to model behaviors and mindsets that are likely to promote desired outcomes in children. For example, setting an example of positive discussions about food ("this bowl of cereal is so delicious and gives me energy") can help children develop flexibility in their relationship with food. <br>Any discussion about the child's weight or body, parental encouragement of dieting, and parental dissatisfaction with their bodies, even during family meals, make girls more likely to develop weight-related issues in the future (Langdon-Daly & Serpell, 2017). <br>Therefore, when having a family meal, be mindful of how you talk about food, your body, and your child's body.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Obesity</h1>
        <p>
            Family meals also serve as an important mechanism for preventing obesity in children and in the long term as they become young adults. Adolescents who have more family meals are less likely to be overweight or obese (Sen, 2006; Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2010). Just once a week, the weekly presence of family meals during childhood reduces the risks of the child being overweight or obese 10 years later, compared to children who never have family meals (Berge et al., 2015). 
        </p>
        <div class="graycolor">
            <h1>Nutritional Well-being</h1>
            <p>Family meals offer numerous nutritional benefits for children. <br>Children from families who eat together tend to have breakfast more regularly, eat more fruits and vegetables, prepare their own meals, and consume foods containing calcium and micronutrients (Fulkerson et al., 2009; Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2010; Verhage et al., 2018). <br>Many of these nutritional benefits persist years later; young adults whose families prioritized eating together consume more fruits and vegetables and also have a stronger desire to share meals with others (Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2010).</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Academic Achievement</h1>
        <p>Children benefit academically and intellectually from having family meals.<br> Mealtime conversation is strongly linked to language acquisition in young children, and family meals help broaden children's vocabulary. <br>Children who perform well on achievement tests (Fruh et al., 2011) and children with high grades (Eisenberg et al., 2004) typically come from families who engage in frequent family meals.<br> Additionally, children whose families regularly eat together tend to read more for pleasure and spend more time on homework (Tepper & Michael, 1999).</p>
        <div class="graycolor">
            <h1>No Time for Family Meals?</h1>
            <p>
                Many factors make family meals inaccessible to some people.<br> Work schedules, children's extracurricular events, difficulty, lack of culinary skills, lack of availability/accessibility to food, or family conflicts can all be barriers to the motivation and ability to integrate family meals. <br>However, if you hope to reap similar nutritional benefits, ensuring the availability and accessibility of fruits and vegetables can help increase their consumption.<br> Additionally, parental modeling of fruit and vegetable consumption as well as parental encouragement significantly increase their consumption in children, even without regular family meals (Watts et al., 2016). <br>
                <br> The reasons why family meals are so powerful stem from parental modeling of positive food behaviors and mindsets, communication about daily activities, parental monitoring of child's food intake, and emotional and social bonds among family members (Eisenberg et al., 2008).<br> If family meals are not feasible for your family, prioritizing these factors throughout your day/week can also help you reap some of the same benefits.
