        <h1>The Dish</h1>
        <p>
            This simple recipe is a quick and easy way to complement your main dishes with a healthy vegetable side. Kale is sautéed in a little olive oil with plenty of garlic. The lemon pepper seasoning provides a nice balance of tangy citrus notes and cracked black pepper. Any dinner would benefit from this addition, whether it's a creamy pasta dish, grilled meats, stir-fries, or hearty roasts.
