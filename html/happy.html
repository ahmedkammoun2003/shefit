            Have you ever noticed that after a good, nutritious meal, you feel overall better, physically, mentally, and emotionally? Perhaps you've noticed that when you don't make the best food choices, your mood also seems affected? Well, that's because our food choices can have a significant impact on our mood (and vice versa!). This article will discuss the bidirectional link between food and our mood, and provide some insights into the impact certain foods and nutrients have on our mood in general. As a bonus, whenever we mention specific foods, we've linked to some of our favorite FB recipes that include that ingredient, so you have ideas on how to incorporate it into your meals!

        <h1>Impact of Mood on Food Choices</h1>
        <p>
            Note that our moods are our general emotional states that tend to last longer. Emotions, on the other hand, are temporary, fleeting experiences of particular feelings. For the purposes of this article, we'll be talking about general mood states.

            Our mood can impact the food choices we make in several ways. Based on our past experiences with foods, we come to
            expect the influence that a food will have on our mood and therefore seek out specific foods in order to feel a particular effect. For example, if we know that chocolate has made us happy in the past, we eat it with the aim of boosting our mood (Ottley, 2000).

            Additionally, one of the major motivating factors in life in general (but also specific to food choices) is that we seek out things that bring us pleasure and avoid things that displease us or are negative in some way. Therefore, especially when we're stressed or in a generally negative mood state, we tend to seek out foods that bring us pleasure. These vary based on personal preferences, but many people enjoy carbohydrates and fatty foods. Stress and busy schedules also lead us to seek out ready-to-eat foods which, without proper planning (which can add to stress), tend to be processed foods with lower nutritional density (Gibson, 2006).
            
            Impact of Foods on Mood
            
            Conversely, the foods we choose to put into our bodies can have a significant impact on our mood. Thankfully, we can use this to support positive choices that can naturally help us combat certain moods and address mental health issues. Here, we'll talk about several nutrients and/or specific foods that impact our mood.
            
            Sugary Foods and Refined Carbohydrates: Much research has been conducted on foods with a high glycemic load. While a full discussion on what constitutes a high glycemic load (or glycemic index) won't be addressed in this article, we'll explain how these foods affect mood. When consumed, sugary foods and refined carbohydrates quickly spike blood sugar, creating a rapid energy boost, and then shortly after, when glucose leaves the bloodstream, they can leave you feeling depleted and craving more food to give you another sugar high.
            
            In studies, healthy individuals exposed to a high glycemic load diet were associated with a significant increase in depressive symptoms (Salari-Moghaddam et al., 2019), as well as anxiety, irritability, and an overall increase in hunger (Firth et al., 2020).
            
            Foods that have the opposite effect are foods high in fiber and have a much less dramatic effect on blood sugar than refined carbohydrates and sugary foods. The fiber in these carbohydrates slows the absorption process and leads to a much lower increase in blood sugar compared to foods containing flours and white sugars. For example, here are some great options:
            
            Barley
            Whole wheat grains
            High-fiber whole grain cereals
            Oat bran and rice bran cereals
            Whole grain pasta
            Whole grain Pumpernickel bread
            Sourdough bread
