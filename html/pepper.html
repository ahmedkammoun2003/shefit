        <h1>The Dish</h1>
        <p>
            Just like the classic stuffed peppers dish, this soup is made from easy-to-find ingredients like ground turkey, green peppers, red peppers, tomatoes, and rice. The red peppers bring a level of natural sweetness while the green peppers add earthy, green touches. Ground turkey replaces traditional ground beef for a leaner protein option. Brown rice is a fabulous whole grain. Being a whole grain means that brown rice contains all parts of the grain: the fibrous bran, protein-rich germ, and carbohydrate-rich endosperm. White rice, on the other hand, has been stripped of the bran and germ. Since these are the most nutritious parts of the grain, brown rice is our choice for maximum nutrition.

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <h1>Prepare in Advance/Time-Saving Tips</h1>
        <p>
            We also use precooked brown rice in this recipe. We're known for preparing or cooking batches of pantry staples that will be frequently used throughout the week – quinoa, brown rice, etc. This really cuts down on overall cooking time as well as prep day. For our advance-preppers, this soup is a fabulous option. Cook, refrigerate, chill, and reheat when ready to enjoy.
