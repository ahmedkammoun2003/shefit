        <h1 >Recommendations Related to Physical Activity</h1>
        <p>
            The latest Canadian recommendations for physical activity during pregnancy indicate that, to maximize the benefits of physical activity, pregnant women should:
        </p>
        <ul > 
            <li class="li">engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.</li>
            <p>
                During moderate-intensity activity, the person should be able to talk, but not sing. The effort should be enough to significantly increase their heart rate (brisk walking, stationary cycling, aqua aerobics, snowshoeing, etc.);
            </p>
            <li class="li" >move at least 3 times per week,</li>
                <p> but preferably every day;</p>
            <li class="li">vary between cardiovascular and muscular activities;</li>
                <p>perform pelvic strengthening exercises</li>
                <p>every day (e.g., Kegel exercises). For optimal results, it is recommended to learn the correct execution technique of the exercises.</p>
        </ul>
        <h1>The Benefits of Physical Activity</h1>
        <p>
            If your doctor or midwife gives you the green light, go for it! Here are some of the benefits demonstrated by research that you will experience if you engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week:
