        <h1>The Dish</h1>
        <p>
            This recipe is partly inspired by the popular English breakfast, with just a slight nutritional modification and simplification for quick and easy preparation, whether it's on busy weekdays or weekends. Homemade turkey sausage patties – well-seasoned with sage, thyme, and paprika – are pan-seared and served with a sunny-side-up egg. A pan-seared tomato and toasted whole wheat bread complete this morning meal. If you're still hungry, feel free to serve this hearty meal with a fruit salad or a warm bowl of cereal.
        </p>
        <h1>Hack this Recipe</h1>
        <p>This turkey sausage recipe can easily be prepared a day or two in advance, either with the raw seasoned mixture or with the pan-cooked and cooled sausage. You can also freeze the cooked sausage, thaw it, and reheat it when you're ready to eat.</p>

            <span class="span">2 tbsp.<br>Red onion<br>peeled and diced</span>
            <span class="graycolor1">1 tsp.<br>Garlic<br>peeled and minced</span>
            <span class="span">125 grams<br>Ground turkey<br>1 cup<br>Canned diced tomatoes<br>½ cup<br>Low-sodium vegetable broth<br>1 cup<br>Cooked brown rice</span>
            <span class="graycolor1">1 ½ tbsp.<br>Green onions<br>chopped</span>
        </div>
        <h1>Preparation Instructions</h1>
        <p>Lightly grease a medium non-stick skillet with non-stick cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.<br>
            Place the ground turkey in a medium bowl and season with garlic powder, sage, thyme, paprika, and a small pinch of salt. Using your hands, mix to combine and divide into 2 patties.<br>
            Once the skillet is hot, add the turkey sausage patties and cook for about 2 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Remove the sausage patties from the skillet, reserve them on a serving plate, and lightly grease the skillet with additional cooking spray.<br>
            Add the egg and halved tomato, cut side down, to the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the egg is cooked to your liking and the tomato is tender.<br>
            Lightly season both with salt and pepper and transfer them to the plate with the sausage.<br>
            Finally, cut the whole wheat toast into quarters and add them to the plate before serving.</p>
