        <h1 class="title">Closed chain exercises actually produce higher activation levels and better represent the real function of the gluteus medius</h1>
        <img src="../photos/valgus.jpeg" class="photoart">
        <p>Indeed, during a band walk exercise, it was demonstrated that the stance leg had higher glute activation levels than the walking leg.
        
        The Stork exercise and single-leg support exercises demonstrated in the main video of this article are effective exercises to exploit this closed chain activation and frontal plane stability:</p>
        
        <p>Make sure to watch the main video to see how these exercises are performed.</p>

        <p>Using a band between the knees during squats is a strategy we still see and is generally used with less experienced training enthusiasts as they tend to let their knees collapse during squats. However, a recent study by Reece et al. (2020) demonstrated that using a resistance band at knee level during squats actually increased knee valgus, especially in individuals unaccustomed to its use (subjects in this study had never done squats with a resistance band before). Aren't they precisely the people targeted for the use of bands between the knees?
        
        These results are partly due to the fact that the subjects did not have the abduction strength to overcome the resistance of the band. As I mentioned earlier, it's not surprising that applying resistance to something that is already weak doesn't offer optimal results.
        
        Given that the knee is a middle joint, we must consider the foot, ankle, and hip as precursors to movement errors reflected at the knee level. Using knee bands to drive movement is unlikely to produce the desired results, and may in fact mitigate the process and outcomes.</p>
